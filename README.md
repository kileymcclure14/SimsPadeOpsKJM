# PadeOpsSims

Simulations run on PadeOps.

Simulation setups use templates for input (both general and turbine) and run files, which are then filled in with Jinja. Thus, the most important files are actually the files that define the paramters that are then filled into the templetes. These is also a "default" value file that contains good default parameters for most of the simulation values. There are what will be used if alteratives are not provided within the simulation file itself.

See the README of each repository for a log of all the simulations run.
